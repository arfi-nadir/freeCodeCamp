                <li>Ace woke up in the Moby Dick to find out he's considered now one of Whitebeard's son, and to keep his crew alive he had to stay.</li>
                <li>Ace however still had the intent to kill Whitebeard, with every attempt ending in failure.</li>
                <li>Marco and Ace started to have a conversation, Marco telling Ace about Whitebeard's father-son relationship. After the conversation Ace finally accepted being one of Whitebeard's sons, and having the Whitebeard symbol on his back.</li>
                <li>One day Ace defeated a pirate named Doma, which made Ace promoted to 2nd Division Commander of the Whitebeard Pirates.</li>

                <li>After a successful plan with Monkey D Luffy, and Mr. 3 to release Ace was executed, Ace was freed and fought along side the Pirates, and escapees. Then attempted escape, but then Akainu started insulting Whitebeard, which made Ace furious then Ace and Akainu fought.</li>
                <li>Akainu's magma was too strong for Ace so he lost the battle, then Akainu attempts to kill Monkey D Luffy while defenseless, but last second Ace came in to block the attack causing fatal hole in his chest. Ace started crying and said his last words before his last moments.</li>
